SPEECH OF HON. WILLIS GEORGE EMERSON,

Lockerby Hall, Grand Rapids, Michigan.

October 29, 1896.


Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen--I am indeed pleased to meet such a
magnificent audience in this manufacturing city of Grand Rapids, noted
from ocean to ocean for her culture, commerce and progress. Especially
am I pleased to speak in your city in behalf of sound money, protection
and reciprocity, under the auspices of the Young Men's Republican Club.
I bring you greeting from the state of Illinois, and promise you
that she will give a majority of 150,000 on next Tuesday for William
McKinley. I am proud to hail from the grand old state of Illinois--a
state that gave to our common country in the darkest days of our
nation's history, Logan, that matchless civilian general; gave the
unconquerable Grant, the tanner from Galena, and offered up as a
holy sacrifice the "rail-splitter" president from the Sangamon
bottoms--Abraham Lincoln. But to-night I remember that I am in the
state of Michigan--magnificent commonwealth--almost illimitable in her
resources, unconquerable in her courage, phenomenal in her progress,
invincible in her pluck, unswerving in her patriotism, the home of the
gallant Alger, and the former abode of that matchless statesman and
patriot--the gifted Zach Chandler. Fellow citizens, we are in the
closing days of the most momentous political campaign ever witnessed in
our common country. He who would question the sincerity or honesty of
a political opponent's views in this crusade must for the time being
forget the school house on the hill and the high plain of intelligence
of American citizenship.


KNOWS "COIN" HARVEY.


Hon. W. H. Harvey, author of Coin's Financial School, is a gentleman I
have known for many years, and for as many years as we have known each
other, we have been warm personal friends. Toward the man I entertain
the greatest respect; toward his theories I regard them as idle,
visionary sophistries as unstable as "the house that was built upon
sand." The student who really gives thought to the financial question
will early discover that Coin's Financial School rests upon a false
foundation and the superstructure must surely fall when beat against by
the irresistable and truth capped waves of facts and history. No better
answer can be given to these misleading and false theories than a plain,
truthful statement of our coinage laws and the effect of legislation
relating thereto. Fellow citizens, whatever else we may be, we are all
Americans, either by birth or adoption; we respect and love the same
flag and the undying principles which it represents. We do not differ in
a desire for good government. We may differ and differ widely, however,
in our opinions and ideas as to what laws will insure the greatest
blessings to the people of this nation. Fortunately for the Republican
party the American people are a reading and a thinking people, and
the problems of the present campaign are now on trial before a jury
of 70,000,000 of honest peers, not one of whom am I willing to believe
would wantonly strike down the flag of our country, or any of its
cherished institutions.


THE PEOPLE A JURY.


This audience is a part of that great jury, who, after the evidence
is all in, will decide one way or the other, with an avalanche of snowy
ballots, as spotless in their purity as the honest hearts of the voters
who cast the verdict into the ballot boxes. As Americans we are justly
proud of our birthright--proud of the air of freedom that kisses the
stars and stripes--our nation's ensign, emblematical of mighty victories
in the past, a guarantee of protection in the present to all who stand
beneath its folds and laden with rich promises of future prosperity.
Our country is greater than the men whose election it is our pleasure
to advocate. It is not men but measures which we are to consider. An
earnest conscientious desire to investigate and determine the right,
should absorb and thrill the heart of every patriotic American voter.
The great parties in the present campaign do not differ so much in
regard to the amount of money as they do in regard to its quality. "It
is not the medium of exchange so much as it is an active exchange of the
medium itself." On the tariff question we do not differ in schedules,
but principles--principles which we, as republicans believe, involve the
welfare of all our people and the prosperity of all classes. Personally
I have every respect for a conscientious, earnest opponent in this
crusade of education, and while honestly differing from them, yet will
endeavor to wound the feelings of none. If I speak bitterly of doctrines
which I believe to be pernicious in theory and ruinous in practice, do
me the justice of not interpreting my remarks as in any sense personal.


MORAL QUESTIONS INVOLVED.


Fellow citizens, this is a campaign embracing both political and moral
questions. It is a political conflict, which the people will sooner or
later acknowledge, to be one of patriotism. A moral conflict, which they
will acknowledge to be indeed sublime.

WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT PATRIOTISM IN TIME OF PEACE IS A SCARCER ARTICLE
THAN IN TIMES OF WAR.

In the guise of citizens men like "Coin" Harvey are attempting
ignorantly or otherwise to undermine and overthrow our nation's honor
and credit, and it is these alone that can perpetuate our liberties and
insure us prosperity.

THE REPUBLICAN PARTY COMES BEFORE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ADVOCATING THE
MAINTENANCE OF THE GOLD STANDARD AND THE USE OF SILVER AS MONEY, IN
THE LARGEST VOLUME POSSIBLE, CONSISTENT WITH SAFETY; ADVOCATING THE
MAINTENANCE OF OUR NATION'S HONOR AND CREDIT; ADVOCATING A TARIFF, NOT
FOR REVENUE ONLY, BUT A PROTECTIVE TARIFF THAT WILL ENCOURAGE
DOMESTIC INDUSTRIES AND GIVE EMPLOYMENT TO ALL OUR PEOPLE; ADVOCATING
RECIPROCITY.

A DOCTRINE WHICH WILL OPEN AN UNLIMITED MARKET FOR THE AMERICAN FARM AND
THE AMERICAN FACTORY A DOCTRINE BEQUEATHED TO THIS GENERATION BY THE NOW
SAINTED JAMES G. BLAINE.

Upon these issues the Republican party comes confidentially to the
people, asking for their suffrage, appealing not to their prejudice but
to their reason, not to their passions, but to their judgment. In
this holy crusade we are lead by that valiant champion of the people's
rights, "that advance agent of prosperity," Maj. William McKinley. On
the other hand we find the Bryanized democrats, populists, and believers
in Coin's Financial School arrayed in a solid phalanx against these
cherished principles which we so ardently believe in.


WILSON LAW CLOSED FACTORIES.


The repeal of the McKinley law in 1893 closed down factories and
manufactories by the hundred and deprived tens of thousands of American
workmen of employment.

UNDER THE OPERATIONS OF THE MCKINLEY LAW THE WAGE EARNERS OF THE UNITED
STATES WERE RECEIVING EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT A LITTLE OVER $41,000,000.
UNDER THE OPERATION OF THE WILSON LAW THEY ARE RECEIVING A LITTLE LESS
THAN $19,000,000 AS A SATURDAY NIGHT PAY ROLL, A FALLING OFF OF OVER
$22,000,000 PER WEEK TO THE WAGE EARNERS OF THIS COUNTRY.

If you ask me what has been the most unfortunate and appalling result
of this wonderfully shrunken pay roll, I will answer by saying that
American workingmen by the thousands have lost the roof that covered
their heads for themselves and families, have been turned into the
highways and are beggars to-day in the most unfortunate sense of
the word. The questions of free trade and protection however, have
practically been relegated into the background this year, and the
sixteen-headed monster of free silver pushed to the front.

FELLOW CITIZENS, FREE TRADE AND FREE SILVER ARE TWIN SISTERS OF INFAMY,
THE ASSERTIONS OF MR. HARVEY TO THE CONTRARY NOTWITHSTANDING.

It was the province of the Republican party four years ago to send forth
its protests and warnings against free trade, and to-day with equal
vehemence it is sending forth its warnings against destroying the high
standard of our nation's finance, and reducing this country to a second
class basis of silver monometallism.


BREAD AND BUTTER THE ISSUE.


FELLOW CITIZENS, THE PAPER ISSUE IN THIS CAMPAIGN IS ONE OF FINANCE,
BUT THE REAL ISSUE IS ONE OF BREAD AND BUTTER. FREE TRADE DURING THE
LAST THREE YEARS HAS PAUPERIZED ITS TENS OF THOUSANDS, BUT THIS FREE
SILVER CRAZE, IF PLACED UPON OUR STATUTE BOOKS, WILL PAUPERIZE ITS
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS.

My friends, I believe, and believe most earnestly, with every throb of
my heart, that in the present campaign the Republican party is the
only true friend silver has. We seek to elevate the silver dollar,
our opponents seek to debase it. The Republican party has provided a
redeemer for every silver dollar. Our opponents seek to destroy and
alienate this redeemer. If the silver dollar was not exchangeable with
gold, it would not be worth any more than a Mexican dollar, or not as
much, for there is less silver in it. Coin's Financial School and free
silver advocates generally, have much to say about the money of the
constitution. Let me say to you, the money of the constitution was based
upon the relative market value of the two metals. The history of the
last 404 years, from 1492 to 1896, is replete with evidence proving
beyond the question of a doubt that the relative or market value of
these metals is continually changing. When Columbus discovered America
in 1492, ten ounces of silver would purchase one ounce of gold; when the
Pilgrim Fathers landed on the rocky and barren coast of New England in
1620, thirteen ounces of silver would purchase one ounce of gold; in
1792 fifteen ounces of silver would purchase one ounce of gold. In 1873
one ounce of gold would not purchase sixteen ounces of silver. To-day
one ounce of gold will purchase almost thirty-two ounces of silver.

THIS FLUCTUATION OF VALUES OF THE TWO METALS IS CONTROLLED, NOT BY LAWS
WE SPREAD UPON OUR STATUTE BOOKS, BUT BY THE LAW OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND,
GOVERNED BY THE COST OF PRODUCTION.


JACKSON AND JEFFERSON.


The patriotism and statesmanship of Andrew Jackson and Thomas Jefferson
were untainted in 1792 by the dangerous influence of a coterie of silver
barons. They simply ascertained as nearly as they could the relative
or market value of the two metals, and determined the legal from the
commercial ratio, placed them side by side and started our mints going
with the unlimited coinage of gold and silver at the ratio of 15 to 1.
As a matter of fact they had overvalued silver; that is to say, the
gold dollar was worth 100 cents, but the silver dollar was only worth 98
cents. Now the rank and file of our forefathers cared very little about
the discrepancy of the 2 cents on the dollars, but the money changers
were abroad in the land in 1792, the same as they are in 1896, and
whenever a gold coin came into their possession it was quietly retired
from circulation. In other words, the cheaper money drove out of
circulation the higher priced money, and as a result, we had silver as
the only hard money currency circulating in this country from 1792 to
1834. Let me quote Thomas Jefferson's own words. In speaking of the
ratio of the two metals, he says:

"THE PROPORTION BETWEEN THE VALUES OF GOLD AND SILVER IS A MERCANTILE
PROBLEM ALTOGETHER."

What statement could be clearer and more concise than that? It being
a mercantile problem, it of course was understood to be subject to
fluctuation and change. Accordingly, in 1834 our forefathers concluded
as their first attempt at a double standard had utterly failed in
keeping the two metals circulating side by side as money, that they
would change the ratio from 15 to 1 to 16 to 1, which they did. It seems
this ratio undervalued silver, that is to say, the gold dollar was still
worth 100 cents, but the silver dollar was worth from 102 to 103 cents.
Gold at once became the hard money circulating medium in this country,
silver the higher priced money, was entirely retired by the money
changers, bullion dealers and silversmiths. This is another illustration
where the cheaper money drove out of circulation the higher priced
money.


GREENBACKS WERE CHEAP MONEY.


In 1861 our country was engaged in civil war, and the greenbacks were
issued as money, and were at once looked upon as a cheaper money than
either gold or silver and immediately drove both gold and silver out
of circulation and kept them out of circulation for seventeen years, or
until we resumed specie payment in 1879. The history of these seventeen
years is another instance where the cheaper money was victorious and
drove out of circulation the higher priced money. Mr. Harvey no less
than four times in his recent speech in this city gave the following
definition of bimetallism: "Bimetallism is the right to use either of
the two metals for money." This condensed answer bears about the same
relation to the correct definition of bimetallism as the Boy Orator
of the Platte compares with those intellectual giants whom he seeks
to imitate, but without success, the immortal Washington and Lincoln.
(Applause). Bimetallism as is understood in the discussion of our
financial question, is the use of both gold and silver as money;
both legal tender money, and the legal ratio between the two metals
determined from the commercial ratio. Throughout Mr. Harvey's published
works and lectures we find him affirming the false principle that money
is a creature of law, and that by operation of law the commercial ratio
between gold and silver can be made to conform with the legal ratio of
16 to 1. Let us follow the author of "Coin's Financial School" for a few
moments, and see where this false principle will carry us.

TO-DAY THE COMMERCIAL RATIO BETWEEN SILVER AND GOLD IS ABOUT 32 TO 1.
MR. HARVEY CLAIMS THAT IF HIS THEORIES ARE SPREAD UPON OUR STATUTE BOOKS
THAT IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE COMMERCIAL RATIO WILL BE 16 TO 1. IF MR.
HARVEY POSSESSES THE SUPERHUMAN POWER OF REDUCING THE VALUE OF GOLD
ONE-HALF, OR DOUBLING THE PRICE OF SILVER, WHICHEVER YOU WILL, AND BRING
THEM TO A COMMERCIAL PARITY AT 16 TO 1, THEN INDEED WOULD HE BE FALSE TO
THE CITIZENS OF THIS REPUBLIC IF HE DID NOT ADD A LITTLE MORE POWER
TO HIS "KEELEY-MOTOR" THEORY, (APPLAUSE) AND MAKE THE COMMERCIAL RATIO
BETWEEN GOLD AND SILVER 15 TO 1, THE SAME AS IT WAS IN 1792, OR BETTER
STILL, IF IT IS A BLESSING TO HUMANITY TO LOWER THE RATIO BETWEEN GOLD
AND SILVER, THEN APPLY A LITTLE MORE OF THIS OCCULT POWER AND MAKE THE
RATIO 13 TO 1, THE SAME AS IT WAS IN 1620, WHEN OUR ANCESTORS CAME OVER
IN THE MAYFLOWER; OR APPLY THE SAME FORCE WITH RENEWED ENERGY AND BRING
THE RATIO DOWN TO 10 TO 1, THE SAME AS IT WAS IN 1492. INDEED, IF THIS
PRINCIPLE IS A BOON TO HUMANITY, AND HIS THEORIES ARE NOT FALSE, WHY NOT
PUSH THE WORK ALONG AND MAKE THE RATIO BETWEEN GOLD AND SILVER 1 TO 1?
(APPLAUSE.)

My fellow citizens, in following my friend Harvey, you are led into a
labyrinth abounding with impossibilities and as impracticable as the
theory of perpetual motion. When the earth is proven to be flat instead
of a globe, when water runs up-hill, when the law of gravitation ceases
to be operative, when the tail wags the dog and not the dog the tail,
then, and not till then, may we seriously consider these perpetual
motion, "Keeley Motor" theories of Mr. Harvey and other double standard
advocates. (Great Applause). If we were unable to keep both metals
circulating side by side when there was a slight discrepancy of only two
or three cents in their intrinsic value, does any intelligent or sane
man believe for a moment whether he is a student of Coin's Financial
School or not, that if we throw open our mints to the free and unlimited
coinage of 52-cent dollars, that they would not at once drive out
of circulation the $630,000000 of gold, now constituting more than
one-third of our circulating medium? If gold, so important a factor in
our medium of exchange both at home and abroad, should retire before
silver--the cheaper money (and the light of experience surely proves
that it would) can any one doubt that we would at once go on to a silver
basis? Can any one doubt that the $625,300,000 of silver now used as
money in this country would not instantly be cut in two so far as its
purchasing power is concerned--that is, shrink from 100 cents, its face
or nominal value, to 52 cents, its bullion value? In the light of past
experience it would surely be a sad commentary on our intelligence as
an enlightened nation, if we had learned nothing in 100 years. If the
illustrious Hamilton and Jefferson were alive, they would, by pursuing
the same policy which actuated them in determining the money of the
constitution, fix the ratio to-day at about 32 to 1, simply because the
relative or market value of the two metals has varied to that extent.


HONESTY AND SOBER JUDGMENT NEEDED.


My countrymen, the questions involved in the present campaign merit
and deserve your most careful thought and study. It is the sober, honest
judgment of the thinking, reading, investigating American citizen that
the Republican party is relying upon for its support. Let me give you a
few facts which possibly you will consider worthy of remembrance:

FIRST. EVERY FREE AND UNLIMITED COINAGE COUNTRY IN THE WORLD IS ON A
SILVER BASIS.

SECOND. THERE IS NOT A GOLD STANDARD COUNTRY ON EARTH BUT WHAT USES BOTH
GOLD AND SILVER AS MONEY.

THIRD. THERE IS NOT A SILVER STANDARD COUNTRY IN THE WORLD THAT USES ANY
GOLD WHATEVER AS MONEY; AND

LASTLY, THERE IS NOT A SILVER STANDARD COUNTRY TO BE FOUND IN THE GREAT
OCEAN OF COMMERCE THAT ROLLS ALL 'ROUND THE WORLD THAT HAS ONE-FOURTH AS
MUCH MONEY PER CAPITA AS HAS THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER GOLD STANDARD
COUNTRIES.

China, Japan, India, Mexico and most of the South American states are
on a silver basis. The United States, England, France, Germany, Belgium,
Sweden and others are on a gold basis.

One of the most interesting facts which the student of finance will
encounter, is the vast difference of the amount of money per capita
between the gold standard and the silver standard countries.


PER CAPITA OF MONEY.


In the countries on a silver basis we find the Central American states
with a per capita of $3.78, Japan with a per capita of only $4.09, India
$3.33, China $2.08, Mexico $5.47. Now note the difference between these
countries and a few that I will mention that are on a gold basis:

The United States has a per capita of $21.10, England $19.98, France
$36.70, Germany $18.78, Belgium $27.82.

In this connection, fellow citizens, let me impress upon your minds the
facts that you cannot go into any country on the face of the earth where
its mints are open to free and unlimited coinage of silver and find a
single gold coin circulating among the people, moreover, that the silver
standard country does not exist where the United States gold dollar, the
United States silver dollar, or the United States paper dollar will
not purchase twice as much merchandise as any dollar which you can find
circulating among its people. I challenge the author of Coin's Financial
School or the Demosthenes of Nebraska, William Jennings Bryan, or any
one else, to successfully contradict this statement.


I AM A BIMETALLIST.


Personally, I am a bimetallist, and confidentially believe the
republican party, guided by its wisdom and patriotism, will during
the McKinley administration, devise ways and means by international
agreement of autimatically adjusting the unsolved problem of true
bimetallism, and keep both gold and silver on a parity at some
given ratio. Silver will then be lifted from its place as one of the
commodities of the earth and dignified as money, side by side with gold.
To-day, I am a bimetallist, an ardent and devoted one, in the sense that
I desire to see both gold and silver circulating side by side as money,
and in the sense that we can have a greater per capita of money in this
country by using both gold and silver as currency, than we possibly
could by driving gold out of circulation, but fellow citizens, I
disbelieve utterly in the possibility of a double standard. The phrase,
"double standard" is a contradiction of terms. Standard means "correct
measure," and you cannot have two different correct measures of value
any more than you can have two different correct yard sticks, or two
different correct results from a mathematical problem, or two different
correct cyclometers on a bicycle. It one is right the other is wrong,
and that is all there is to it. England tried the imaginary double
standard for 470 years, and never succeeded in keeping the two metals
circulating side by side, and finally gave it up as an utter failure.
France with all the ingenuity of her inventive people, changed the ratio
of gold and silver 118 times in twelve years in trying to balance on the
double standard tight rope. We commenced trying it in 1792, and went on
to a silver basis and remained there for 42 years, or until we changed
the ratio from 15 to 1, to 16 to 1, in 1834. This change of ratio placed
us on a gold basis, where we remained for a number of years. In 1861
we went on a paper basis and remained there for a number of years,
and finally went back on to a gold basis in the common accepted
understanding of the question, where we have since remained and the
progress and prosperity of the United States during the last third of
a century has been without a precedent in the history of the civilized
world, and yet, I believe with my whole heart, that in the evolution
of this financial question, hastened on by agitation, a plain of
understanding will be reached higher and beyond that which has ever
heretofore obtained in any of the civilized nations of the earth, and
it will come through deliberations and councils in the republican
party--the party of progress--and when it comes it will lighten the
burdens and bless humanity.


THE CRIME OF '73.


Mr. Harvey and all silver advocates talk to us about the crime of 1873.
Let me say here and now there was no crime committed in 1873, directly
or indirectly.

IF THERE WAS A CRIME COMMITTED, SENATORS JONES AND STEWART OF NEVADA, THE
PRESENT HIGH PRIESTS IN THE SILVER MOVEMENT WERE THE CHIEF CONSPIRATORS,
FOR THEN, AS NOW, THEY WERE AMONG THE LARGEST SILVER MINE OWNERS IN THE
UNITED STATES, AND THEY VOTED FOR THE BILL.

Prior to 1873 we had coined in this country, all told, about 8,000000 of
silver dollars, since 1873 we have coined up to January 1st, 1896, $547
914,340 of silver, about $426,000,000 of which are standard dollars.
Since January 1st, 1896, we have coined over $13,000,000 of standard
dollars. During last August we coined 2,650,000 of silver dollars,
and the profit to the government--the people--was between $800,000 and
$900,000.

WEBSTER SAYS: "DEMONETIZATION IS TO DEPRIVE OF VALUE, OR TO WITHDRAW
FROM USE AS CURRENCY."

Does it look very much as though we had withdrawn silver from use as
currency? In what way have we deprived silver of value? It is a full
legal tender for all debts, public and private, and without limit as
to amount, and has been for the last eighteen years. These, fellow
citizens, are facts which you will not find within the covers of "Coin"
Harvey's books, it looks as though we had added value to it, since
the silver dollar circulates side by side with the gold dollar,
notwithstanding its bullion value is 48 cents less than its nominal or
face value.


CONSISTENT FRIEND OF SILVER.


THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS EVER BEEN THE CONSISTENT FRIEND OF SILVER
AND TO-DAY IS IRREVOCABLY COMMITTED TO THE DOCTRINE OF INTERNATIONAL
BIMETALLISM, BUT IS UNALTERABLY OPPOSED TO SILVER MONOMETALLISM.

For one, I am not willing to see all the gold in this country driven out
of circulation and the purchasing power of silver reduced to its bullion
value. In other words, I am not ready to see the per capita of money in
this country reduced fully one-half and our nation doing business on a
Mexicanized silver basis. Wages are the last schedule to advance, and
as fully 95 per cent, of the male adults in the United States are wage,
salary or fee earners, there would be almost universal want, misery
and suffering bequeathed to these people, because of such a reckless,
unpatriotic and unbusiness-like experiment. What party then is the real
friend of silver? The party that is trying to maintain the parity of
the two metals, or the party that is protesting friendship in unstinted
terms and yet committed to the folly of reducing silver to its bullion
value? Fellow citizens the proposition in a nutshell is this:

THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BELIEVES THAT THE COINAGE OF SILVER SHOULD BE
RESTRICTED BY LAW AND COINED ON GOVERNMENT ACCOUNT. MR. BYRAN AND HIS
FOLLOWERS BELIEVE IN THE FREE AND UNLIMITED COINAGE OF SILVER ON PRIVATE
ACCOUNT. WHEN THE GOVERNMENT COINS SILVER, UNDER EXISTING LAWS, IT GETS
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST OF THE BULLION AND THE STAMP THAT IS
PLACED UPON IT. THIS IS KNOWN AS THE GAIN OR SEIGNIORAGE AND IS PAID
INTO THE TREASURY OF THE UNITED STATES THE SAME AS IS PROVIDED BY LAW
REGULATING SUBSIDIARY COINS. IN THIS WAY EVERY MECHANIC, EVERY FARMER,
EVERY LABORER, IN FACT EVERY CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES GETS HIS
PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THIS GAIN.


DO NOT DEMAND BIMETALLISM.


What "Coin" Harvey and the advocates of free silver demand is not
bimetallism, but the unlimited coinage of the silver dollar, not at
the just ratio of 32 to 1, but at the unjust ratio of 16 to 1, not on
government account, but on private account. To-day the government--the
people--are receiving the benefit of the 48 cents on each silver dollar
coined, that being the difference between the cost of the bullion and
the face value of the dollar. The government--the people-will lose these
48 cents if silver is coined on private account. The question is, my
countrymen, who will get these 48 cents on each dollar, who will be
benefitted by this change? We know the government will lose 48 cents on
each dollar, the question is, who will receive it, or will this profit,
now accruing to the government--the people--be lost as completely as the
value of this building would be to the owner if it burned to ashes and
there was no insurance? (Applause.) I am pretty well acquainted with
the mining business, have spent many years of my life in the mining
districts of the west, and am the owner to-day of mining properties in
Oregon and in Colorado, and also largely interested in one of the most
noted silver mining properties in Old Mexico, and I know whereof I
speak, when I say to you that English capitalists and American silver
kings own a majority of the stock of nearly every incorporated silver
mining company in this country of any prominence.

It is beginning to look to me like "there was a pretty good-sized
African in the wood pile somewhere." (Laughter and applause.)


FREE TRADE SHOULD BE UNDONE.


Eight years ago, and again four years ago, through the influence of
the Cobden Club, England attempted to subdue America. She succeeded in
prostrating our industries, impoverishing our people, and increasing our
public debt, but let us hope that the intelligence of American citizens
will rise up in its full might and undo the free trade blunder of 1892.
It now looks to me as if there was a gigantic trust of silver kings and
English capitalists attempting to again subdue free America. Evidently
there never was such a concert of action in the United States as
has taken place during the last few months in regard to this silver
question. The rapidity with which it has travelled all over this
country, to say the least, has been phenomenal. There is an old saying,
that "a falsehood will travel a thousand miles while truth is getting
its boots on." Fellow citizens, go forth and tell the misguided
advocates of free silver and believers in the false theories of "Coin's"
Financial School to rejoice in their strength while it is called
to-day, for, by the living God "truth has its boots on" and is marching
triumphantly out among the people, tearing away the webs and veils
of delusion and hypocrisy and appealing to the people, not to their
passions, but to their intelligence, their reason and their honor. The
people are not ready to advance by going backwards, they are not ready
to be Chinaized, to be Japanized, South Americanized, Mexicanized or
subsidized by a coterie of silver barons and English capitalists, who
are attempting by stealth to nail the wage earners and farmers of this
country to an unholy cross of depreciated silver. (Applause.)


GOES AFTER BRYAN.


William Jennings Bryan tells us in his Knoxville, Tennessee, speech,
that there is no danger of a silver flood. "Coin" Harvey makes the same
statement, notwithstanding the world's production of silver for the year
1894, at only about 63 cents an ounce, amounted to the fabulous sum
of $216,000,000, a greater annual production than ever before in the
history of the world, and only exceeded by the output of silver for the
year of 1805, which amounted to $235,000,000, and still he claims there
is no danger of a silver flood. All that Mr. Bryan asks for is, that the
reins of government and the keys of the United States treasury be turned
over to himself and his followers, and they will try the experiment. I
hardly think the people of the United States are ready to invest in any
more political experiments. The experiment of four years ago has proved
quite enough. No flood of silver! The effrontery and insult to the
intelligence of mankind by this degenerate democracy and silver
advocates surpasses understanding. (Applause.) Fellow citizens, the
so-called crime of 1873 is a myth and destitute of substance. The
so-called conspiracy of that year is also a myth and without substance.
You might just as well go out and from the housetop proclaim that the
horse has been dehorserized, because of a huge conspiracy entered into
by electricity and the bicycle. Why not ask that the noble animal be
rehorserized, so that its selling price will be $150 or $200, the same
as it was in "ye olden times." (Applause.)


IMPROVED HARVESTING METHODS.


The old-fashioned methods of reaping the yellow fields of wheat has
also been ousted by the conspiracy of the late improved harvester and
binder. The old fashioned cradle has been decradleized. Why not form
an alliance all over this country to recradleize the cradle, and make
common warfare against the up-to-date binder? Even the old McCormick
reaper has been dereaperized and the succeeding invention, the header,
has been deheaderized, and who shall not say in this onward march of
progress, in this wonderful advancement of our civilization, in this age
of discovery and invention, that sooner or later the up-to-date binder
of to day will not be debinderized by the inventive genius of some
American citizen? (Applause.) Now, let us see, fellow citizens, what the
so-called crime of 1873 has done for prices of various commodities. One
of the stock declarations of Mr. Bryan and Mr. Harvey and their cohorts
is that prices should be restored and wages should be increased. One of
two things is very apparent, either the framers of the Chicago platform
did not consult the statistics of the United States, or else they
imagined the voters would not. "Coin" Harvey and the silver advocates
generally seek to establish their position by quoting statistics of
average prices of certain great commodities like wheat and cotton
claiming that prices commenced falling in 1873, and their decline has
continued ever since. These arguments are those of the delusionists and
must crumble before the evidence and the facts. Let me say to you that
prices did not commence falling in 1873, but in 1864-5.


WHY ARE THEY NOT HONEST?


If these men are not demagogues, pure and simple, why do they not
inform the "dear people" why prices fell more during the eight years
precedent 1873 than they have ever fallen since?

"COIN" HARVEY HAS NEVER EXPLAINED WHY, AND IF HE DID, HIS THEORY WOULD
VANISH LIKE THE MIST BEFORE THE RISING SUN OF TRUTH.

For example, cotton fell from $1.01 1/2 in 1864, to 17 cents a pound
in 1871. Or wheat for instance. The average farm price of wheat in the
United States for the year 1874 was 94 cents a bushel, paper currency,
or only 84 cents a bushel in gold. The average farm price of wheat in
the United States for 1891 was 83 cents a bushel, the same in 1890,
while in 1888 the average farm price of wheat in this country was 92
cents a bushel, or 6 cents a bushel higher than it was in 1874. Thus it
will be seen that an unfair and false impression is trying to be created
among the people by both Mr. Bryan and his followers. Perhaps Mr.
Bryan and the free silver advocates would like to know where I get
my statistics. I answer them by saying they are taken direct from the
United States Statistical Abstract, which deservedly ranks high as
an authority. In looking over this work I could not help wondering if
"Coin" Harvey and our opponents who are shouting so loud and lustily for
the free and unlimited coinage of silver and a restoration of prices,
would not like to apply their cure-all to refined sugar, which was
selling in 1872 at 12 3/5 cents per pound, and only 4 3/5 cents per
pound in 1892, or for instance, illuminating oil was quoted in 1872
at 23 cents a gallon, and only 5 9/10 cents per gallon in 1892.
Manufacturers of bar iron in 1872 were receiving $97.63 per ton for
their product, and only $29.96 a ton in 1894. A keg of nails cost $5.46
in 1872, and $1.08 in 1894. A box of window glass that cost $3.40 in
1873, sold only at $1.70 in 1891. A carpet that cost $1.14 a yard
in 1873, can be purchased today for 36 cents a yard. The steamboat
transportation companies hauling wheat from Chicago to New York City,
by lake and canal, are receiving a compensation to-day of a little less
than 4 1/2 cents a bushel, but in 1873 they were receiving 24 1/2 cents
per bushel, for every bushel they carried.


SHALL PRICES BE RESTORED.


The question is, do the people of the United States want these prices
restored?

WE ARE WILLING AS AMERICANS THAT AMERICAN INDUSTRIES AND HOME
COMPETITION SHALL ADJUST PRICES, BUT WE ARE NOT WILLING THAT PRICES OF
LABOR SHALL BE ADJUSTED IN THIS COUNTRY BY AMERICAN WORKMEN ENTERING
INTO COMPETITION WITH THE PAUPERIZED LABORERS OF EUROPE.

From the same reliable statistics and undoubted authority we find that
wages have materially advanced in this country during the last third of
a century. The increase from the old double standard wages of 1860 to
those of 1890, have been no less than 58 per cent, in money, and 72 per
cent, in purchasing power. This does not look very much like a falling
off. I will admit that the price of wheat has declined and declined
rapidly since 1892, but you must remember that Grover Cleveland was
elected president that year and is still in the White House. Give us
back a protection that protects, and we will not only insure abundance
of labor for all our people, but will guarantee that farm products
generally will command better prices. (Applause).

FELLOW CITIZENS, I EARNESTLY BELIEVE THAT "COIN" HARVEY AND ALL THOSE
WHO ARE ADVOCATING THE FREE AND UNLIMITED COINAGE OF SILVER AT THE
UNJUST AND UNTRUE RATIO OF 16 TO 1, AS A NOSTRUM FOR OUR ILLS, ARE
ADVOCATING A THEORY AS MISLEADING AS IT IS WICKED AND UNHOLY. NO THEORY
MORE FALSE WAS EVER ADVANCED OR CALCULATED TO MORE THOROUGHLY DECEIVE
THE EARNEST, INDUSTRIOUS, GOD FEARING PEOPLE OF THIS NATION.

Let us undo the free trade blunder of 1892 and we will hear no more
about the mythical crime of 1873. (Applause.)


PROTECTIVE TARIFF THE REMEDY.


My friends, a tariff that protects; reciprocity that opens up a
market for our surplus articles from the American farm and the American
factory; a sound currency, and the business confidence which will
follow, are the remedies for the unfortunate condition of bankruptcy
into which the country has been submerged by political stupidity.

THE QUESTION IS SIMPLY ONE OF HONESTY OR DISHONESTY.

Shall thrift and economy be rewarded by robbery? Shall the widow's mite
and the savings deposited in the banks of this country be cut in two
by changing our money to silver monometallism? Shall the two and a half
billions of school bonds from all over the country, held by English and
American capitalists and payable in gold, be doubled, and a double tax
fall upon the shoulders of the tax payers of this nation? Shall the
toilers of this land, the wage-earners on farm and in factory, be robbed
every Saturday night of one-half of their weekly wages?


LABORERS SHALL BE HONESTLY REWARDED.


NO. THIS BLOT OF REPUDIATION SHALL NOT SMIRCH THE UNTARNISHED
ESCUTCHEON OF AMERICAN PATRIOTISM, NEITHER SHALL THE TOILING MASSES
RECEIVE AS THEIR REWARD FOR HONEST LABOR A "MESS OF DEPRECIATED SILVER
POTTAGE."

We are now asked to desert the old ship of state that has carried this
nation through many storms, through many conflicts, and invariably
anchored us in the snug harbor of safety and maintained our country on
the map of the world, and added many stars to the old flag. We are asked
by these new and false prophets of finance to destroy this grand old
ship, freighted with the hopes and ambitions of seventy millions of free
American citizens; this old ship tested by time, tried by adversity,
taut and trim as a May queen and invincible as a Bessemer steel iron
cladder, a ship that was launched by Washington and the patriots of 100
years ago, and piloted by such noble men as Lincoln, Grant, Garfield and
Hayes. We are asked to desert this ship of known safety, and embark in
an untried craft and sail away on the turged waters of an unknown sea.
A craft manned by a free silver captain, piloted by free tradeism, and
ballasted with bombs of anarchy and repudiation; a craft whose very
slimy plank is reeking with condemnation; whose mutinous crew are ready
to scuttle her in mid ocean; whose worthless and shoddy sails are fanned
by the angry breath of high heaven; and whose nearest port is bankruptcy
and perdition. (Long continued applause.)

MY FELLOW CITIZENS, THE TRUE SOLUTION OF THE PRESENT FINANCIAL
DEPRESSION LIES ALONG OTHER LINES, AND THIS BRINGS US FACE TO FACE WITH
THE REAL PROBLEM.

Perhaps you have noticed already in this campaign that no one is quite
so disgusted with remarks on the tariff as a Byranized democrat or a
populist? The impoverished condition of the country, resulting from the
free trade crime of 1893 is so apparent on every hand that when we lay
the skeletons at their doors they frankly confess judgment, but tell us
that other questions of more vital importance are now before the people.

MY FRIENDS, THE ENDLESS CHAIN OF AMERICAN PROSPERITY HAS BEEN BROKEN
AND NEVER WILL BE MENDED UNTIL THE DRAWN FIRES FROM OUR FURNACES ARE
REKINDLED AND THE FREE TRADE SMOKE CONSUMERS ARE REMOVED FROM THE TALL
CHIMNEYS IN OUR MANUFACTURING DISTRICTS. (APPLAUSE.)


A PRINCIPLE UPHELD BY STATESMEN.


It is not in any exulting spirit that we refer to a protective tariff,
but rather because it is a great and underlying principle of national
prosperity; a principle bequeated to this nation by Washington, upheld
by Henry Clay, fostered by Abraham Lincoln, championed by William
McKinley, and supported by the reciprocity of James J. Blaine. Prior to
the free trade crime of 1892, we heard nothing about a diminished gold
reserve.

IN THOSE HALCYON DAYS CONFIDENCE FLEW ABROAD IN THE LAND ON THE WINGS OF
PROSPERITY.

Capital was freely invested and labor employed at the highest wages. The
gold reserve occasioned no uneasiness and required no thought. Instead
of acting as an alarmist it steadily grew, acting as a balance wheel to
an ever-increasing confidence. The surplus was employed in paying off
the national debt; and during President Harrison's administration
our national indebtedness was reduced almost as much as it has been
increased by the present administration. What has happened during the
last three and a half years of grace?

THE ALLURING AND MUSICAL HUM OF INDUSTRY IS NO LONGER HEARD IN THE LAND
OF FREEDOM. THE PENDULUM OF TIME HAS SWUNG BACK AND REVEALED TO THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE THE GHASTLY SKELETON OF WANT AND FORCED IDLENESS
CONCEALED IN THE FREE TRADE CLOSET.

Our great commercial institutions have fallen into a most deplorable and
unhappy state, misery and want, with pinched and sorrowful countenances
are walking hand in hand up and down by deserted workshops. The honest
face of toil blushes as hunger drives him to eat the bread of charity.
The stilled wheels of industry throughout our land, and deserted
and idle farms are indeed eloquent in their silence in behalf of a
protective tariff. (Applause.) Capital that was formerly employed in
manufacturing enterprises has been withdrawn, while the balance of trade
with other nations is frightfully against us.


ENGLAND HAS BEEN SERVED.


IF ENGLAND HAD HAD A POLITICAL PARTY MANUFACTURED TO ORDER BY THE MOST
SKILLED ARTISANS OF THE EARTH, SHE COULD NOT HAVE HAD ONE MADE THAT
WOULD MORE FAITHFULLY SERVE HER COMMERCIAL PURPOSES THAN HAS THE PRESENT
ADMINISTRATION.

Let us briefly inquire into the cause. Take, for instance, the sheep and
wool industry, which a few years ago was a prominent one in your state.
Under the stimulus of protection, we had in this country in 1884,
50,500,000 sheep. Then Grover Cleveland was elected president, and this
was followed by the democratic free wool indictment of 1885, known
as the Mills bill. The wool growers of America became alarmed, they
fattened and sold their sheep to the butchers by the millions. This
slaughter continued for four years, or until Gen. Harrison was elected
to the presidency in 1888. The authentic statement shows that the number
of sheep had been reduced in this country from 50,500,000 in 1884 to
41,300,000 in 1888. President Harrison's election stopped the slaughter,
and under the stimulus of the McKinley law the industry gained rapidly
and at the close of Mr. Harrison's administration the total number
of sheep in the United States was 47,800,000. (Applause.) In 1892 Mr.
Cleveland was again elected president. This was followed by the repeal
of the McKinley law and the enactment of legislation hostile to the wool
industry. During the last three and a half years the number of sheep in
this country has been reduced from 47,800,000 to 38,500,000, or fewer
sheep than there was in this country in 1873, or at any time since
the so-called crime of that year. So much fellow citizens, for the
democratic free wool joke on the American people.


HE TALKS OF WOOL.


Now let us talk for a few moments about the price of wool. For ten
years preceding the repeal of the McKinley law, the average price of
Ohio X.X.Washed wool in the Boston market was a little over 31 1/5 cents
per pound. April 1, 1896 wool was quoted in the same market at 18 cents
a pound. Such a startling contrast in prices needs no comments. As
millions of our sheep were slaughtered we were compelled to import wool
and woolen textiles into this country sending our money abroad, which
should have been paid to the American farmer and sheep raiser. Instead
of this we paid our money over to foreigners in exchange for wool and
woolen textiles, which came into this country like a flood when the
McKinley law was repealed and the duty removed. The result was that the
woolen mills of America were practically all shut down and thousands
upon thousands of American workingmen and women were thrown out of
employment, and in turn, were unable to purchase the products from the
American farm. No wonder the American farmer found a ready market for
his potatoes in 1892, when all our people were employed, at from 50c to
60c a bushel; and to-day, when our people are unemployed, the farm
price of potatoes is from 25c to 30c a bushel. Let us see what sort of
a stewardship has been going on in this country for the last few years.
For the twenty-five months ending November 1, 1892, our balance of trade
with other nations was in our favor to the extent of $28,245,641. That
is what the McKinley law and protection did for this country. That,
fellow citizens, is what we call good business methods. Selling to other
nations more than we purchased from them to the extent of $28,245,641,
or an average of $1,129,822 per month, or $37,660 per day. (Applause.)


WHAT THE RECORD IS.


Now, let us look at Mr. Cleveland's record for the fifteen months
ending December 1, 1895--this, you will remember, was under the Wilson
bill. We find the balance of trade, instead of being in our favor,
was against us to the enormous amount of $70,494,044, or an average of
$4,699,603 per month, or $153,653 per day. That, fellow citizens, is
a pretty good sized daily loss. That is what we call remarkably poor
business methods, and so does every one within the hearing of my voice
who is disposed to be fair in the consideration of this question. But
why speak further of the evils of free trade, or multiply examples of
the blessings of protection. The record of the last three and a half
years has been an object lesson, both impressive and eloquent. It is
gratifying to note that some of the ultra free traders in 1892 are the
most pronounced protectionists in 1896. Many of the old time democrats
who are proud of the traditions of their party, proud of the principles
which they have cherished for so many years, are refusing to follow the
platform adopted by the degenerate democracy of 1896. Let us mete out
justice to whom justice is due.

WHEN THE FLAG OF OUR COUNTRY, WAVING ABOVE FORT SUMTER WAS FIRED UPON
BY THE ENEMIES OF GOOD GOVERNMENT, THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF THE
DEMOCRATS OF THE NORTH FORGOT THEIR POLITICS, SHOULDERED THEIR MUSKETS
AND BECAME PATRIOTS. (APPLAUSE.) THIS YEAR OF GRACE, 1896, WHEN THE GUNS
OF ANARCHY AND SOCIALISM ARE DIRECTED AGAINST THE SUPREME COURT OF THE
UNITED STATES AND THE NATION'S HONOR AND CREDIT, THESE SAME DEMOCRATS BY
THE TENS OF THOUSANDS ARE TURNING FROM THAT PLATFORM OF REPUDIATION AND
ARE THE STANCHEST OF PATRIOTS. (APPLAUSE.)


SPIRIT OF REVOLUTION.


It cannot be denied that a spirit of wantonness and revolution
prevailed at the Chicago convention, repudiation was openly advocated
on the floor of the convention hall and made a part of the platform
adopted. The red hand of anarchy grappled the throats of all who dared
oppose the extreme measures advocated by that seething sea of restless
agitators. I wish to draw a line of demarkation, clear and distinct,
between the old Simon-pure democracy of Hamilton and Jefferson, and this
new degenerate democracy of Bryan, Tillman and Altgeld. It is true the
framers of the Chicago platform claim the name, but the tenants and
faith are strangely at variance with the traditions and principles of
the old Jeffersonian doctrine. My countrymen, it is not alone the volume
of money which the people want, but they demand its activity in trade
and commerce. If you ask me how this can best be accomplished, I will
answer by saying, protect American industries and universal confidence
will surely follow. (Applause.)


GREAT IS CONFIDENCE.


CONFIDENCE IS THE SHIBBOLETH OF PROSPERITY.

CONFIDENCE THAT GOOD DOLLARS MEAN WELL PAID LABOR.

CONFIDENCE THAT WELL PAID LABOR MEANS GOOD TIMES.

CONFIDENCE THAT WAGES PAID TO AMERICAN WORKINGMEN WILL POSSESS THE SAME
PURCHASING POWER AS THE BEST MONEY IN THE CIVILIZED WORLD.

CONFIDENCE THAT A PENSION POLICY, JUST AND GENEROUS TO OUR LIVING
HEROES, WILL BE RESTORED.

CONFIDENCE THAT NO OLD SOLDIER IS TO BE DEPRIVED OF HIS QUARTERLY CHECK
WITHOUT TRIAL BY JUDGE OR JURY.

CONFIDENCE THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WILL MAINTAIN A REDEEMER FOR EVERY
SILVER DOLLAR COINED.

CONFIDENCE THAT A RETURN OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO POWER WILL START
EVERY MILL AND FACTORY IN THIS COUNTRY, WITHOUT THE AID OR CONSENT OF
ANY OTHER NATION OR NATIONS ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH.

CONFIDENCE THAT INTERNATIONAL BIMETALLISM, SO ABLY ADVOCATED DURING
PRESIDENT HARRISON'S ADMINISTRATION, WILL BE VIGOROUSLY PROMOTED BY THE
MC'KINLEY ADMINISTRATION. (GREAT APPLAUSE.)

CONFIDENCE THAT A VOTE FOR MC'KINLEY AND HOBERT IS A VOTE FOR THE HOME
AND THE FIRESIDE.

CONFIDENCE THAT VERMONT AND MAINE HAVE PENCILED A BRIGHT PROPHECY OF
HOPE IN THE EASTERN SKY.

CONFIDENCE THAT THE DRAGON HEAD MONSTER OF STATE RIGHTS IS NOT TO BE
RESURRECTED IN THIS COUNTRY. (APPLAUSE.)

CONFIDENCE THAT SOUND MONEY AND PROTECTION ARE THE PILLARS OF JACKIN AND
BOAZ IN THE TEMPLE OF AMERICAN HONOR AND PROSPERITY.

CONFIDENCE THAT THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES IS TO REMAIN OUR
BULWARK OF JUSTICE AND ALL THE GATES OF HELL SHALL NOT PREVAIL AGAINST
IT. (APPLAUSE.)


PROUD OF BEING A REPUBLICAN.


Fellow citizens, I am a Republican and proud of my party's history.
The history of the United States has been made rich and resplendent with
victories and achievements of our party. We are proud of our nation's
history from its earliest dawn down to the present, and for the valuable
lessons it has taught. We would not expunge or obliterate a single line.
We accept it as a whole, from Plymouth Rock to Bunker Hill, from Bunker
Hill to Fort Sumter, from Fort Sumter to Appomattox, and from Appomattox
down to the campaign of 1896. We dedicate crowns of laurel for the
giants who have evolved the mighty principles and tenets of the
republican party--Washington and Grant, Blaine and Logan, Sherman and
Garfield, Harrison and McKinley, and most of all, that gentle soul, that
man of equal poise, whose peer has never lived since the days of blessed
Galilean--Abraham Lincoln! (Applause.) Our history is one of greatness
and sublimity. Its pages are rich with the names of orators more
eloquent than a Burke, with the names of statesmen more acute than the
"Iron Chancellor" and the names of warriors greater and mightier than
Napoleon.

IN THE DARK AND TURBULENT DAYS OF THE REBELLION, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY,
WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF DEMOCRATIC PATRIOTS, SAVED THIS NATION, WHILE
NOW IN THE CLOSING DAYS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY, BY THE LIVING GOD,
PATRIOTS WILL SAVE AND PROTECT OUR NATION'S HONOR.

Ours is the greatest nation on earth, and the possibilities of the
future are almost limitless; if we make no mistake in the great
principles of protection, reciprocity and a sound currency, which have
for their immediate object the betterment of the conditions of the
wage-earners of this land.


MARCHING TO GREATEST VICTORY.


Following the leadership of our gallant standard bearer, that brave
civilian soldier on the field of battle, that statesman without a
peer, that friend of the toiling millions, that companion of every old
soldier, that invincible leader of men, Major McKinley, we are advancing
proudly on to the greatest political victory of modern times. In the
life of Major William McKinley, we find nothing but purity and ability,
bravery and compassion, and I promise you that on the fourth day of
next March he will be inaugurated president of this republic; a republic
whose flag, "Old Glory," the stars and stripes, floats over seas and
land, peerless and without price, the emblem of power and protection to
all. My friends, we must restore our protective system. Already it has
accomplished wonders for the laborers of America, and its mission in
behalf of prosperity and posterity has only commenced. It has enabled us
to perfect a system of finance that is a marvel to all nations, and has
raised our credit to a place among the first countries of the earth. It
has elevated the manhood of every American citizen, dignified labor,
and instilled a more universal education throughout our land than can
be found in any other civilized country on the face of the globe. It has
made the flag of our nation emblematical of love, liberty, protection,
reciprocity, honor and all that is great and grand of human thought.
Major William McKinley is our Bruce at Bannockburn in this struggle for
national honor, unlimited labor and higher wages. In the golden casket
of his great soul rests the immortal principles which we advocate, and
in his heart burns the undying fire of love for America and American
institutions. The righteousness of our cause is our strength, while he
is our hope and will lead us triumphantly on to certain and splendid
victory. (Applause.) But what about William Jennings Bryan?

               "Like a comet he rose to our vision,

                   Like a comet he soon will depart;

               And 'tis certain his untimely going

                   Will chill every popocrat's heart,

               In the coming cyclone of November

                   We know his race will be run,

               And forever and aye, oh, let him remember,

                   How our leader, McKinley has won."

                        (Great Applause.)

        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™

1.F.


1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.


1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.


Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™


Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.


Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.


Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation


The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.


The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up

and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact


Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation


Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.


The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.


While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.


International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.


Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.


Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works


Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.


Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.


This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
